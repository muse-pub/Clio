In Greek mythology, Clio (traditionally /`klaɪoʊ`/, is the olympian muse of history.

### Depiction
Clio, sometimes referred to as "the Proclaimer", is often represented with an open parchment scroll, a book, or a set of tablets.

### Mythology
Like all the muses, Clio is a daughter of Zeus and the Titaness Mnemosyne, goddess of memory. 

Along with her sister Muses, she is considered to dwell at either Mount Helicon or Mount Parnassos.

Other common locations for the Muses are Pieria in Thessaly, near to Mount Olympus.

She had one son, Hyacinth, with one of several kings, in various myths—with Pierus or with king Oebalus of Sparta,
or with king Amyclas, progenitor of the people of Amyclae, dwellers about Sparta. 
Some sources say she is also the mother of Hymenaios. Clio was made to fall in love with Pierus by Aphrodite, for Clio had derided her for her love affair with Adonis.
Other accounts credit her as the mother of Linus, a poet who was buried at Argos, although Linus has a number of differing parents depending upon the account, 
including several accounts in which he is the son of Clio's sisters Urania or Calliope.
